	- **Social Media Blog API**
	- Project Overview
		- This social media application will be an api backend without a frontend. The app will have the ability to manage user accounts and messages that they submit to the application. Users will be able to see all of the messages posted to the site as well as the messages posted by a particular user. In either case, we require a backend which is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.
	- Instructions:
		- The Social Media Blog API Project will be due exactly 3 weeks from the day it is assigned.
		- Expectations
			- In order to complete this project, the expectation is to have all user stories complete and all test cases pass.
		- Submissions
			- The due date for this project is reflected above. If you have not already submitted your project by that time, your project will automatically submitted and will be graded as-is.
		- User Stories To Complete
			- 1. User Registration
			- 2. Login
			- 3. Create New Message
			- 4. Get All Messages
			- 5. Get One Message Given Message Id
			- 6. Delete a Message Given Message Id
			- 7. Update Message Given Message Id
			- 8. Get All Messages From User Given Account Id
		- Note: More detailed information about the user stories can be found in the instructions of the dive.

	- To create a Social Media Blog API using Java Spring with the specified user stories, you can follow these steps:
		- 1. Set Up Your Development Environment:
			- Install Java if you haven't already.
			- Install Spring Boot.
			- Set up your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.
			- Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing user accounts and messages.
		- 2. Create a Spring Boot Project:
			- Create a new Spring Boot project using your IDE or use Spring Initializer (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a project.
			- Add necessary dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Security, and Spring Data JPA.
		- 3. Define Entity Classes:
			- Create Java classes for User and Message entities, and annotate them with `@Entity` for JPA.
		- 4. Set Up Spring Security:
			- Configure Spring Security to handle user registration and authentication.
		- 5. Create Repositories:
			- Create repositories for User and Message entities by extending the `JpaRepository` interface.
		- 6. Implement User Registration and Login:
			- Create endpoints and services for user registration and login.
			- Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization.
		- 7. Implement Message Creation, Update, and Deletion:
			- Create endpoints and services for creating, updating, and deleting messages.
			- Implement access control to ensure that users can only modify their own messages.
		- 8. Implement Message Retrieval:
		- Create endpoints and services to retrieve messages:
			- Get all messages
			- Get one message by its ID
			- Get all messages from a particular user by their account ID
			  
			  9. Implement Controllers:
		- Create REST controllers to handle incoming API requests and map them to the appropriate service methods.
		  
		  10. Testing:
			- Write unit tests for your service methods using a testing framework like JUnit.
			- Test all user stories, ensuring that they pass according to the expected behavior.
			  
			  11. Documentation:
			- Document your API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms using tools like Swagger or Spring RestDocs.
			  
			  12. Error Handling:
			- Implement error handling to provide meaningful error responses to clients.
			  
			  13. Validation:
			- Implement input validation to ensure data integrity and security.
			  
			  14. Deployment:
			- Deploy your Spring Boot application to a server or a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.
			  
			  15. Security:
			- Ensure proper security measures are in place, such as input validation, authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
			  
			  16. Testing and Debugging:
			- Thoroughly test your API to ensure it functions correctly and securely. Debug any issues that arise.
			  
			  17. Documentation and Maintenance:
			- Provide clear API documentation for users and maintain the application as needed.
			  
			  Remember to follow best practices, design patterns, and security guidelines throughout the development process. Additionally, make use of Spring Boot's features to simplify common tasks like database access and REST API development.
