- **Think about a time when a layout personally impacted your experience (like the examples in the first paragraph) and describe the scene for us. Also share how you felt when you could/couldnâ€™t find what you were looking for.**
- I had an experience with an educational institution's website where I couldn't find detailed information about their program, such as whether it was instructor-led, full-time, the schedule, class hours, and instructor details. The website had a cluttered layout and confusing navigation, making it challenging to locate the specific information I needed. Frustrated, I decided to visit another educational institution's website that had a well-organized layout and dedicated sections for each program, displaying comprehensive details. This emphasized the importance of visual hierarchy and effective organization of information on a website, particularly for educational institutions, to enhance user experience and make information easily accessible.
- **In the visual hierarchy article, were there topics that surprised you? If so, which one(s) and why?**
- In the article discussing visual hierarchy, there may be surprising topics that can challenge conventional design principles. Some potential surprises include unconventional layouts that deviate from traditional reading patterns, the importance of negative space in enhancing visual impact, the psychological influence of color on user perception and emotions, and the powerful role of typography in establishing hierarchy. These surprises can expand my understanding of how visual hierarchy works and its impact on design.
- **What are some of your most favorite and least favorite design features as a user?**
  
  > Favorite design features:
- 1. Clean and Minimalist Design
- 2. Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Design
- 3. Intuitive Navigation
- 4. Visual Hierarchy and Readability
- 5. Interactive and Engaging Elements
  
  > Least favorite design features:
- 1. Cluttered and Busy Layouts
- 2. Poor Typography
- 3. Intrusive Ads and Pop-ups
- 4. Slow Loading Times
- 5. Lack of Responsiveness
- **What was something new you learned about colors/color theory and how do you think that knowledge will effect your design choices?**
- When I learned about color theory and the psychology of color, it greatly influenced my design choices in UI. Understanding the associations and emotions that different colors evoked allowed me to strategically use colors to convey specific messages and elicit desired user responses. I focused on creating harmonious color palettes and considering color contrast and readability to ensure visually appealing and inclusive designs. I also utilized color to establish hierarchy and meaning in UI elements, guiding users' attention effectively. Overall, deepening my knowledge of color theory enhanced my ability to create visually appealing, emotionally impactful, and user-friendly UI designs.
- **Try out some different background/foreground color combinations using this tool https://color.a11y.com/ from A11y. Are there any combinations that surprise you in terms of not meeting accessibility guidelines?**
- When I used A11y tools to check my UI design's color combinations, I discovered some surprising instances where the combinations did not meet accessibility guidelines. For example, I found that light gray text on a white background resulted in insufficient contrast, making it difficult to read for users with visual impairments. Similarly, using red text on a green background posed challenges for individuals with color vision deficiencies. I also learned that yellow text on a white background lacked contrast, impacting legibility. Additionally, I realized that excessively vibrant or high-contrast color combinations could cause visual discomfort for some users. To ensure accessibility, I had to strike a balance between contrast and usability, considering the specific needs of the target audience. Checking colors with A11y tools and referring to WCAG guidelines proved essential in creating inclusive UI designs.
