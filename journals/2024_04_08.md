- #ctd #[[Mindset Assignment]] Node week 7
	- Based on your current skillset, here are your answers to the debugging questions:
	- **When asked to think about debugging, the first three adjectives that jump to mind are:**
		- Methodical: I approach debugging with a systematic and organized method, breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
		- Frustrating: Debugging can be challenging and sometimes frustrating, especially when the solution is not immediately apparent.
		- Analytical: I use my analytical skills to examine the code carefully, identify patterns, and determine the root cause of the issue.
	- **Are there any debugging practices that you’ve already tried and found helpful?**
		- Divide and conquer: I have found it helpful to break down the problem into smaller parts to isolate the issue.
		- Debugging tools in IDEs: I utilize the debugging tools provided in Integrated Development Environments to step through the code and inspect variables.
		- Logging and error messages: I use logging and error messages to track the flow of the program and identify where the issue occurs.
		- Test-driven development (TDD) and Unit Testing: I have found writing tests before implementing code helps in identifying bugs early in the development process.
		- Pair programming and code reviews: Collaborating with others provides different perspectives and insights that can help in identifying and solving bugs.
		- Reproduce the issue: I ensure that I can consistently reproduce the bug before attempting to fix it, which aids in understanding the problem.
		- Use version control: I use version control systems to track changes and revert to previous states when needed, which can be helpful in debugging.
	- **Any you haven’t tried yet, but want to practice in this upcoming week?**
		- Version Control: While I have used version control, I want to focus on practicing using version control specifically for debugging purposes, such as using `git bisect` to identify the commit that introduced the bug.
