	- AI: I want to develop an video editing app for volley ball players who are hobbyist to use AI to edit the 10 best moments of their playing session.
	- For example, when a player spends hours playing their game on a weekend, the app should should be able to highlight the best moments from all their recording an make a montage or recommend series of selectable timestamps to make a new video that will contain from spikes, to scores, to celebrations, etc.
	- How do I approach building this app?

	- @Amir so... looks this app does this nicely (not a niche one, but if you're pursuing this, it's a matter of reverse engineering what this folks are doing and aim it directly for this niche)
