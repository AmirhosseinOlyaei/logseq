	- #ai : I want to develop a video editing app for volley ball players who are hobbyist to use AI to edit the 10 best moments of their playing session.
	- For example, when a player spends hours playing their game on a weekend, the app should should be able to highlight the best moments from all their recording an make a montage or recommend series of selectable timestamps to make a new video that will contain from spikes, to scores, to celebrations, etc.
	- How do I approach building this app?
	-
	- @Amir so... looks this app does this nicely (not a niche one, but if you're pursuing this, it's a matter of reverse engineering what this folks are doing and aim it directly for this niche)

	- and the prompt after that to clarify and get you use stories and peroduct requirements (i,e, what and how you will build things):
	- We are pick the JavaScript learning app, please expand on the product requirements (using a user-story fomat) we will be using React and Node.js for the stack (if relevant, recommend other stack as well)

	- The follow-up prompt for comparing ideas:
	  
	  You will be given a few ideas of apps to build organized by their authors. Review the ideas, and suggest the pros and cons and pick the top two with detailed rationale and references. Fore the top 2, provide suggestions on the on the next steps

		- **Wireframing and UI Design**:
			- Create wireframes or low-fidelity mockups for the key screens or pages of the application, such as the login/signup, user profile, toy listing form, toy listing browse page, messaging system, and more.
			- Collaborate with designers or UI/UX experts to turn the wireframes into high-fidelity mockups or prototypes, defining the visual design, color scheme, typography, and overall branding.
		- **Architecture and Database Design**:
			- Decide on the overall architecture of the application, including the tech stack, frameworks, and libraries to be used.
			- Design the database schema for storing user data, toy listings, messages, ratings/reviews, and any other relevant data.
			- Plan for scalability, security, and performance considerations.
		- **Project Management and Task Assignment**:
			- Set up a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) to track the progress of tasks and issues.
			- Assign tasks to team members based on their expertise and availability.
			- Establish a sprint or iteration schedule for development cycles.

		- Creating wireframes or low-fidelity mockups is an essential step in the UI design process. Here's a brief guide on how to approach wireframing for the key screens of your toy exchange application:
		  
		  1. **Login/Signup Screen:**
			- Include fields for email/username and password.
			- Provide options for logging in with Google or Facebook.
			- Include links for "Forgot Password?" and "Create Account" for new users.
			  
			  2. **User Profile Page:**
			- Display user information such as name, email, location, and phone number.
			- Provide options to edit user information.
			- Include a section for preferred methods of toy exchange.
			  
			  3. **Toy Listing Form:**
			- Include fields for toy name, description, age range, and method of pickup.
			- Provide options to upload pictures of the toy.
			- Include a submit button to post the listing.
			  
			  4. **Toy Listing Browse Page:**
			- Display a list or grid of toy listings with images and brief details.
			- Include filtering options based on age range, location, or toy type.
			- Provide a search bar for users to search for specific toys.
			  
			  5. **Messaging System:**
			- Design a simple chat interface with a list of conversations on one side and the chat window on the other.
			- Include options to send messages, attach images, and view conversation history.
			  
			  6. **Toy Exchange Management:**
			- Create a dashboard for users to manage their toy listings, including options to edit, delete, or mark as exchanged.
			- Provide a system for users to track the status/stage of their exchanges.
			  
			  7. **Ratings and Reviews:**
			- Design a section where users can rate and review other users or toys.
			- Include options for users to view their own ratings and reviews.
			  
			  8. **Subscription and Favorites:**
			- Provide a feature for users to subscribe to notifications for new toy listings.
			- Allow users to save their favorite toy listings for easy access.
			  
			  When creating wireframes, focus on the layout and structure of each screen without getting into the details of the design. Use simple shapes and placeholders for text and images. The goal is to outline the user flow and the placement of elements on each screen. Once the wireframes are complete, you can move on to creating high-fidelity mockups and eventually the final UI design.
