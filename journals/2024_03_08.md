	- and the prompt after that to clarify and get you use stories and peroduct requirements (i,e, what and how you will build things):
	- We are pick the JavaScript learning app, please expand on the product requirements (using a user-story fomat) we will be using React and Node.js for the stack (if relevant, recommend other stack as well)

	- The follow-up prompt for comparing ideas:
	  
	  You will be given a few ideas of apps to build organized by their authors. Review the ideas, and suggest the pros and cons and pick the top two with detailed rationale and references. Fore the top 2, provide suggestions on the on the next steps
	  
	  Here are the idea:
