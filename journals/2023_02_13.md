- [[Group-work 1: The Craigslist Rebuild]]
	- >Opportunity to collaborate and contribute to the team
	- **Goal**: Craigslist has hired your team to help re-design three sections of their website:
		- The Homepage: [https://boston.craigslist.org](https://boston.craigslist.org/)
		- The Community section: [https://boston.craigslist.org/search/ccc#search=1~list~0~0](https://boston.craigslist.org/search/ccc#search=1~list~0~0)
		- The blog: [http://blog.craigslist.org](http://blog.craigslist.org/)
	- **Prerequisite materials**
		- **Read** Starting from Scratch (Refactor UI, Chapter 1). [Download the book here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msimbo/student-hub-old/main/resources/Refactor%20UI.pdf)
		- **Watch and practice** [Getting Started with Alpine.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=1rDU3Y0Wlnw&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fprograms.ulem.org%2F&embeds_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fprograms.ulem.org&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title)
	- **How to approach this**
		- ** UI/X Crash Course**: Understand the "shortcuts" of good design by reading Chapter 1 of Refactor UI, Starting from Scratch. [Download the book here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msimbo/student-hub-old/main/resources/Refactor%20UI.pdf)
		- **2. JS Library Crash Course:** Learn the "quick" javascript library you will use for interactivity by watching
		-
		- Play Video
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **3. Design the Mockup**: As a team, browse the web for inspiration and document you findings. [Start from this case-study](https://www.behance.net/gallery/130770383/Craigslist-Redesign-Case-Study-Concept?locale=en_US), then browse these [design concepts](https://dribbble.com/tags/craigslist)
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **4. Get Mockup Approval:** As a team, shortlist 3 designs you want to use for your redesign inspiration. [Book an office hour](https://calendarhero.to/msimbooffice) to discuss and get approval to proceed — in this session we will work on "converting" the best option to your Figma mockup.
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **5. Craft your plan & issues** After getting approval for your mockup, create a shared repo in the [msimbo GitHub page](https://github.com/orgs/msimbo/repositories) to create and assign issues.
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **6. ****Get Scope-of-Work Approval:**** **After creating the 1st batch of issues, [Book an office hour](https://calendarhero.to/msimbooffice) to discuss and get approval to proceed with the rest of the steps
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **7. Develop Your Solution:** Starting working on the issues. For coding I strongly recommend webstorm and [connect it to GitHub](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiVtPDoiov9AhVDk4kEHcq4Az0QwqsBegQIDBAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiV0iW8L6yt8&usg=AOvVaw3vCNj-5zjNSuWKcep-UDDf) —  your team will be working on the same repo, on different branches.
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **8. Iterate on project:** During every group session, check-in on your respective progress, collaborate (or peer-code) with webstorm to confirm you're on track for your respective goals.
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **9. Q/A and Prepare Production Version**: After the work is done, all team members will merge their work and fork the repo to their personal GitHub.
		  **
		  **
		  
		  **10. Submit your work:** From your personal GitHub, push the work to Vercel, then submit the following:
