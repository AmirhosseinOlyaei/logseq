	- In the presentation, we covered essential steps such as connecting your GitHub repository, configuring deployment settings, and more.
	- I demonstrated how to deploy code from GitHub to Vercel, a powerful cloud platform for hosting apps. The process is remarkably straightforward, allowing you to easily share your project with others using a generated URL. During the demo, we also encouraged everyone to try deploying their own code to Vercel.
	- Key Highlights:
	- 👨‍💻 Amir demonstrates the seamless deployment of code from GitHub to Vercel.
	- 🌐 Vercel is a robust cloud platform designed for hosting applications.
	- 🚀 Deployed code can be effortlessly shared with others via a unique URL.
	- 🔄 Continuous integration and continuous deployment streamline the entire deployment process.
	- 🔒 Utilizing environment files is crucial for keeping API keys secure.
	- 📦 Vercel enables the creation of files and other actions during the build process.
	- A big shoutout to Code the Dream and our instructor Gaetan for providing the opportunity to showcase these concepts. Thanks for tuning in!
