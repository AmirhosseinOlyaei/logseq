	- ### Why do you want to be a software developer?
	- My desire to become a software developer has evolved to not only acquire and apply new programming skills but also to leverage my expertise in the MERN stack and UI design to create impactful, user-centric applications. The opportunity to lead projects, like the PlayItForward app, and collaborate with diverse teams has reinforced my ambition to innovate and excel in this field.
	- ### What do you plan to do with your skills after the class ends?
	- With the skills honed during the class, I plan to continue developing and refining my portfolio projects, such as the volleyball video editing app and the toy exchange platform. My aim is to utilize these projects to showcase my capabilities to potential employers and secure a position as a full stack web developer, where I can contribute to meaningful software solutions.
	- ### Can you think of a time when a growth mindset helped you learn or achieve something new?
	- Embracing a growth mindset was crucial during my time as a teaching assistant and leading the practicum group at Code the Dream. Despite initial uncertainties, my belief in continuous improvement and learning from feedback enabled me to effectively mentor others, facilitate collaboration, and drive the successful development of our full-stack web application.
	- ### What other mindsets have helped you learn new skills?
	- In addition to a growth mindset, an adaptive mindset has been vital in my recent endeavors. Adapting to new technologies and methodologies, such as design system UI for front-end development and Google Auth for authentication, has allowed me to stay current and versatile. Furthermore, a collaborative mindset has enhanced my ability to work effectively within a team, ensuring that our collective skills are leveraged for the success of our projects.
