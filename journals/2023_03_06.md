		- To expand more on the methodology you used to develop a website, you can follow these steps:
			- 1. Define your approach: Explain the approach you used to develop the website. Did you use a specific methodology or framework? For example, did you follow an agile methodology or use a specific design framework like Material Design or Bootstrap?
			- 2. Explain the project phases: Describe the different phases of your project. This could include planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. For each phase, explain the goals, deliverables, and outcomes.
			- 3. Discuss the design process: Talk about how you approached the design of the website. Did you create wireframes or mockups? What factors influenced your design decisions? Did you consider user experience and accessibility?
			- 4. Explain the development process: Describe how you developed the website. What programming languages did you use? Did you use a specific development environment or IDE? Did you follow best practices like writing clean code and using version control?
			- 5. Discuss testing and deployment: Explain how you tested the website and deployed it to a live server. Did you use automated testing tools or manual testing? What challenges did you face during deployment?
			- 6. Highlight lessons learned: Finally, reflect on your methodology and identify any lessons learned. What worked well and what could be improved? What would you do differently if you were to develop a similar website in the future?
		- By following these steps, you can provide a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the methodology you used to develop your website. This will help others understand your approach and learn from your experience.
