	- Why Every Day 1 Starts with a Knowledge Base Application? 🔍
	  
	  Because having a structured hub for my content is the compass that enhances my personal productivity. 🚀
	  
	  Often, when I'm searching for specific know-hows, I turn to Google or seek the wisdom of AI. For instance, figuring out how to set focus on an element in a React functional component using a hook.
	  
	  But what about my own creations scattered across various platforms? The ones that hold pieces of my journey but might be challenging to trace or even inaccessible?
	  
	  There are times, I find myself pondering:
	- Where's the link to my Cloud 3-Tier Architecture presentation? 🌐
	- Where's the slide deck for my AI-powered marketing application development? 🤖
	- Where's that teach-back showcasing a real-world machine learning application on the cloud and the intricacies of integrating AI into operations? 🎓
	  
	  Truth is, I always #markdown notes in #Logseq. For instance:
	  I systematically document how I structure dependencies in my Spring Boot API for future reuse. 
	  And keep a record of specific responses to web development mindset questions every week at the coding school. 
	  What a challenge without a record. 📚
	  
	  This realization led me to embrace the power of a knowledge base — a central repository where my insights, projects, and learnings converge. Every Day 1 starts with a deliberate effort to capture and organize my journey. It’s about efficiently navigating the stored information that will be used later, providing a unified and organized space for information management.
	  
	  So, if you find yourself asking these questions too, consider the impact of having a knowledge base at your fingertips. It streamlines the pursuit of continuous learning and personal productivity. 🧠✨
