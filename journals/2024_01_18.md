		- @channel Hi everyone!  Here are some talking points both for this channel and for the upcoming mixer... Let's get to know each other better
		  
		  It's always good to reflect on what's led you to your current place in life.  This week share about:
		- What you did before CTD/are doing now?
		- What do you like about it?
		- What don’t you like about it?
		- Why did you decide to transition into web development?
		- Why did you choose front end or back end?
		- What is something you’re hoping to learn more about during the rest of class/practicum?
		  
		  I know, I know... a lot of what's and why's this week!  Answer the ones you want to, be as short or long in your answers as you like.  Bottom line, it's always good to take a moment to pause and reflect on the things you've accomplished and overcome, and the reason you're currently invested in the things you're doing.  After reflection, sometimes the path forward becomes a bit more clear.
		  
		  Anyone still searching for a team or teams searching for more teammates please post in this channel or on a thread of this post so you all can find each other!

		- Hi Mary and everyone!👋
		- 1. Before/Now: Previously, I was exploring different areas in tech, including cloud technologies, and now I've taken a significant step by joining a coding school. This marks a pivotal phase in my journey into software development. 🚀
		- 2. Likes: I love being part of this community where I'm constantly learning, both under the guidance of mentors and through interactions with classmates. 📚👥
		- 3. Dislikes: The journey to becoming a full-stack developer is increasingly challenging, and I realize that at some point, I may need to specialize in either front-end or back-end development. 🤔
		- 4. Transition to Web Development: I decided to pursue web development because it's the perfect blend of creativity and logic. It also allows me to solve real-world problems, which is incredibly fulfilling. The ability to build something that can reach and impact a global audience is both inspiring and rewarding. 🖥️🌐
		- 5. Front End or Back End Choice: Even though I love front-end development, I'm leaning towards full-stack because it offers a complete view of the software development life cycle. 🔄
		- 6. Hoping to Learn: I'm looking forward to deepening my understanding of how build applications that streamline tasks with advanced user friendly interfaces, all while maintaining scalability.☁️📈
		- I agree, reflection is key to understanding our journey and shaping our path forward!
