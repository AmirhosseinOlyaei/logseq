	- Week 3
	- – In your own words, what does it mean to be curious about something?
	- – What’s one thing that you were curious to learn more about recently (this doesn’t need to be coding-related)? How did you learn more about it?
	  – What’s one best practice you’ve learned in your first few weeks at CTD that you don’t know “the why” behind? How can you find out “the why”?
