	- Week 3
	- – In your own words, what does it mean to be curious about something?
		- Being curious about something means having a strong desire to learn and understand more about a particular topic or subject. It involves asking questions, seeking information, and exploring new ideas or perspectives. Curiosity can be sparked by a variety of things, such as a personal interest, a problem that needs to be solved, or a desire to better understand the world around us. It is a natural human inclination to be curious, and it often leads to discovery, creativity, and innovation. When we are curious, we are open-minded, engaged, and motivated to learn, grow, and expand our knowledge and understanding of the world.
	- – What’s one thing that you were curious to learn more about recently (this doesn’t need to be coding-related)? How did you learn more about it?
	- – What’s one best practice you’ve learned in your first few weeks at CTD that you don’t know “the why” behind? How can you find out “the why”?
