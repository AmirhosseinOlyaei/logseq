	- In your own words, what does it mean to be curious about something?
		- **Being curious about something means having a strong desire to learn and understand more about a particular topic or subject. It involves asking questions, seeking information, and exploring new ideas or perspectives. Curiosity is a powerful motivator for learning and exploration, and it can lead to new discoveries and insights. It can be sparked by a variety of things, such as a personal interest, a problem that needs to be solved, or a desire to better understand the world around us. It is a natural human inclination to be curious, and it often leads to discovery, creativity, and innovation. When we are curious, we are open-minded, engaged. Overall, curiosity is an important trait that can help us grow and develop both personally and professionally.**

	- What’s one thing that you were curious to learn more about recently (this doesn’t need to be coding-related)? How did you learn more about it?
		- **Recently, using AI technology, I was able to update my profile to showcase my skillsets for potential employers and job opportunities. During this experience, I was curious to explore how this technology can help my career. During this exploration I was pleasantly surprised by the various AI modules that helped me gain clarity and empower my ability to present myself. This exercise allowed me to be more self-reflective of my achievements and envision areas of growth to better define my purpose and next steps in expanding my network and building my future career. Therefore, I learned my stance and contribution in this path.**

	- What’s one best practice you’ve learned in your first few weeks at CTD that you don’t know “the why” behind? How can you find out “the why”?
		- If I come across a best practice at CTD that I'm not sure why it's done that way, it's important for me to seek clarification from my instructors or mentors. They can provide me with the context and rationale behind the practice and help me understand its significance.
		- Additionally, I can research the best practice on my own by reading industry publications, blogs, and research studies. This can help me gain a deeper understanding of the practice and its benefits. I can also consult with subject matter experts or attend mentor sessions or study sessions related to the practice to expand my knowledge.
		- By understanding the why behind a best practice, I can improve my ability to apply it effectively and align it with the goals and values of CTD. It can also help me develop a more comprehensive understanding of the field and contribute to my success as a developer.
