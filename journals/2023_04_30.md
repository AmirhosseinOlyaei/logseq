	- – In your own words, what does it mean to be curious about something?
		- **Being curious about something means having a strong desire to learn and understand more about a particular topic or subject. It involves asking questions, seeking information, and exploring new ideas or perspectives. Curiosity is a powerful motivator for learning and exploration, and it can lead to new discoveries and insights. It can be sparked by a variety of things, such as a personal interest, a problem that needs to be solved, or a desire to better understand the world around us. It is a natural human inclination to be curious, and it often leads to discovery, creativity, and innovation. When we are curious, we are open-minded, engaged. Overall, curiosity is an important trait that can help us grow and develop both personally and professionally.**

	- – What’s one thing that you were curious to learn more about recently (this doesn’t need to be coding-related)? How did you learn more about it?
		- **Recently, using AI technology, I was able to update my profile to showcase my skillsets for potential employers and job opportunities. During this experience, I was curious to explore how this technology can help my career. During this exploration I was pleasantly surprised by the various AI modules that helped me gain clarity and empower my ability to present myself. This exercise allowed me to be more self-reflective of my achievements and envision areas of growth to better define my purpose and next steps in expanding my network and building my future career. Therefore, I learned my stance and contribution in this path.**

	- – What’s one best practice you’ve learned in your first few weeks at CTD that you don’t know “the why” behind? How can you find out “the why”?
		- When I come across a best practice that I am not sure why it's done that way, it's essential to understand the underlying reasoning behind it. I can start by asking my colleagues or supervisor who introduced the practice and understand the context and rationale behind it.
		- If you're still not satisfied with the explanation or need more information, you can do some research on your own. You can search for industry standards, best practices, or research studies that support the practice. Additionally, you can consult with subject matter experts, attend training sessions or conferences, or reach out to professional organizations for guidance.
		- It's important to understand the why behind a best practice to ensure that it aligns with your organization's goals and values and to improve your ability to apply it effectively.
