	- Got it! Here are your revised answers:
	- **"Aha" moments**: One of my "aha" moments in the Node.js class was when I finally understood the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. It was a game-changer for me to realize how promises and async/await can be used to handle asynchronous operations, making my code more efficient and easier to read.
	- **Enjoyment and challenges**: I've really enjoyed working on projects where I can apply what I've learned to build something tangible, like the PlayItForward application. It's rewarding to see my code come to life. The hardest part for me has been managing my time effectively, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities like attending classes, leading practicum groups, and volunteering.
	- **Excitement and worries**: Before the Node.js class started, I was excited about the opportunity to deepen my understanding of web development and to work on more complex projects. I was worried about keeping up with the pace of the class and making sure I could balance my studies with my other commitments.
	- **Journey ahead**: I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness about what's still to come in the Node.js class and in my journey as a software developer. I'm looking forward to learning more about Express.js and integrating it with the front-end technologies I've been working with. I'm also eager to continue developing my PlayItForward application and to see it evolve into a fully functional platform. At the same time, I know there will be challenges ahead, but I'm confident that I can overcome them with perseverance and a willingness to learn.
