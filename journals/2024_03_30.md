	- Got it! Here are your revised answers:
	- **"Aha" moments**: One of my "aha" moments in the Node.js class was when I finally understood the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. It was a game-changer for me to realize how promises and async/await can be used to handle asynchronous operations, making my code more efficient and easier to read.
	- **Enjoyment and challenges**: I've really enjoyed working on projects where I can apply what I've learned to build something tangible, like the PlayItForward application. It's rewarding to see my code come to life. The hardest part for me has been managing my time effectively, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities like attending classes, leading practicum groups, and volunteering.
	- **Excitement and worries**: Before the Node.js class started, I was excited about the opportunity to deepen my understanding of web development and to work on more complex projects. I was worried about keeping up with the pace of the class and making sure I could balance my studies with my other commitments.
	- **Journey ahead**: I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness about what's still to come in the Node.js class and in my journey as a software developer. I'm looking forward to learning more about Express.js and integrating it with the front-end technologies I've been working with. I'm also eager to continue developing my PlayItForward application and to see it evolve into a fully functional platform. At the same time, I know there will be challenges ahead, but I'm confident that I can overcome them with perseverance and a willingness to learn.

	- Middleware functions are used to execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware in the stack. This allows for modular, reusable code that can handle tasks like logging, parsing request bodies, and handling errors.
	- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or a data storage system. In the context of web development, CRUD operations are often used to interact with a database through an API or a web application's backend.
	- To access the information in a `.env` file in your app, you can use the `dotenv` package in Node.js. First, install the package with `npm install dotenv`, then at the beginning of your main file (usually `index.js` or `app.js`), add `require('dotenv').config();`. This will load the variables from your `.env` file into `process.env`.
	- To protect the contents of the `.env` file from being stored in your GitHub repository, you should add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file. This will ensure that the `.env` file is not tracked by Git and thus not pushed to your repository.
