				- TODO As a user I can see the static “All Projects” page # 51
				- TODO Update description
					- The goal of this project is to create a static web page called "All Projects" using the React.js framework. This page will display a list of all available projects in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate manner. The page will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which will be implemented as React components. While the page will not have any working functionality, it will provide users with a clear and concise overview of all available projects, allowing them to easily find and select the project they are interested in. This will ultimately improve the user experience and help increase engagement with the website.
