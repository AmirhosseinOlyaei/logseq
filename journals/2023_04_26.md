	  3-Tier Architecture Presentation 
	  Be ready to talk about the “what,” “how,” and “why” of the components and services you used to build the demo. This includes:
	- VPC + relevant networking components
	- NAT gateway
	- Internet Gateway
	- EC2 instances
	- Autoscaling
	- Load Balancing
	- Amazon Aurora MySQL
	- Security groups
	- Systems Manager Session Manager
	-
	- You should also be able to explain why we deployed across multiple availability zones and have different tiers in our architecture.
	-
	- **Resources:**
	- [**Here**](https://www.notion.so/bf2f9552e0b644a4a2900ca705d4bb52) you can watch Shivani’s example demo recording (download it from the first row of the upload table)
	- [**Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/screen-share.html)** is instruction on how you can share your screen using Amazon Chime
	- [**Here**](https://answers.chime.aws/articles/132/recording-a-chime-meeting.html) is instruction on how to record your demo using Amazon Chime. If your need more help please reach out to your mentor for assistance
	-
	- **General tips:**
	- Try to keep your demo at or under 35 minutes
	- There are many ways to present a demo. One suggested style is to accompany it with architecture diagrams to help set the context (while you record a screen share), but feel free to make it your own.
	- Present your architecture as if you are talking to folks who are extremely new to AWS to ensure your explanations are thorough.
	- Try not to talk too fast or move through your demo too quickly. Speak clearly and with confidence, you are the expert!
	- We encourage you to practice multiple times, by yourself, with peers, and/or your mentor before you go to record!
	-
	- **Here are some questions we encourage you to think through before you record and be able to answer/explain during your presentation:**
	- Why did you deploy across two availability zones?
	- Why did you choose to use a 3-tier web application?
	- How did you access your instances?
	- How did you configure your instances?
	- How is this different from implementing from on premises?
	- What makes this highly available, scalable, resilient and secure?
	- What can we change if we were bringing this to production?
	- \
	- I am providing an overview of the components and services used to build the demo and explain why we deployed across multiple availability zones and have different tiers in our architecture.
	-
	- Firstly, the demo is built using the 3-tier architecture model, which separates the application into three layers: presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. This architecture improves scalability, performance, and security.
	-
	- The presentation layer consists of the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), which distributes incoming traffic to multiple instances in the application layer. The ELB ensures high availability and fault tolerance by automatically distributing incoming traffic across healthy instances.
	-
	- The application layer consists of Amazon EC2 instances, which run the application code. We have deployed these instances across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and resiliency. The use of multiple availability zones ensures that if one availability zone experiences an outage, the application can continue to run in another availability zone.
	-
	- The data layer consists of Amazon Aurora MySQL, which provides a managed relational database service that offers high performance, scalability, and availability. Amazon Aurora automatically replicates data across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and durability.
	-
	- To access the instances, we used Amazon's Systems Manager Session Manager, which provides secure and auditable instance management. With Session Manager, we can manage instances without exposing SSH/RDP ports, which improves security.
	-
	- We also used Amazon VPC to create a private network for our resources, and we configured security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from the instances. We used NAT Gateway to enable instances in the private subnet to access the internet while keeping them secure.
	-
	- To ensure that the application is scalable, we used autoscaling. Autoscaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on the traffic to the application.
	-
	- We deployed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and resiliency. If we only deployed in a single availability zone and that zone experiences an outage, the application would become unavailable. Deploying across multiple availability zones helps ensure that the application remains available even if one availability zone experiences an outage.
	-
	- We used the 3-tier web application model because it helps improve performance, scalability, and security. Separating the application into three layers enables us to scale each layer independently, which ensures that the application can handle high traffic loads without sacrificing performance.
	-
	- If we were bringing this to production, we would need to configure monitoring and alerting to help us identify and troubleshoot issues quickly. We would also need to ensure that we have appropriate disaster recovery and backup plans in place to ensure that we can quickly recover from an outage. We would also need to ensure that we have implemented appropriate access controls and security measures to protect our resources.
