	- **What was something new you learned about colors/color theory and how do you think that knowledge will effect your design choices?**
		- When I learned about color theory and the psychology of color, it greatly influenced my design choices in UI. Understanding the associations and emotions that different colors evoked allowed me to strategically use colors to convey specific messages and elicit desired user responses. I focused on creating harmonious color palettes and considering color contrast and readability to ensure visually appealing and inclusive designs. I also utilized color to establish hierarchy and meaning in UI elements, guiding users' attention effectively. Overall, deepening my knowledge of color theory enhanced my ability to create visually appealing, emotionally impactful, and user-friendly UI designs.
	- **Try out some different background/foreground color combinations using this tool https://color.a11y.com/ from A11y. Are there any combinations that surprise you in terms of not meeting accessibility guidelines?**
		- When I used A11y tools to check my UI design's color combinations, I discovered some surprising instances where the combinations did not meet accessibility guidelines. For example, I found that light gray text on a white background resulted in insufficient contrast, making it difficult to read for users with visual impairments. Similarly, using red text on a green background posed challenges for individuals with color vision deficiencies. I also learned that yellow text on a white background lacked contrast, impacting legibility. Additionally, I realized that excessively vibrant or high-contrast color combinations could cause visual discomfort for some users. To ensure accessibility, I had to strike a balance between contrast and usability, considering the specific needs of the target audience. Checking colors with A11y tools and referring to WCAG guidelines proved essential in creating inclusive UI designs.
