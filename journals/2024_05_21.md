	- 🔵 Code the Dream Practicum final demo:
	- 🎥 Here's the recording of our presentation; it starts around the 31-minute mark.🛠️
	- This project took us two months to finish,
	- starting with two weeks of ideation and product requirements gathering,
	- followed by one week of UI design in Figma,
	- and five weeks of coding.
	- We used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Node, Express, and React),
	- hosted our images on a Google Cloud Storage bucket 📂,
	- and used Google Auth for authentication.
	- Finally this full-stack app is deployed on Render for production.
