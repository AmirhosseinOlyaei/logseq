- [[CtD]] [[Mindset Assignment]] week 12
	- **– Think about a time when a layout personally impacted your experience (like the examples in the first paragraph) and describe the scene for us. Also share how you felt when you could/couldn’t find what you were looking for.**
		- I had an experience with an educational institution's website where I couldn't find detailed information about their program, such as whether it was instructor-led, full-time, the schedule, class hours, and instructor details. The website had a cluttered layout and confusing navigation, making it challenging to locate the specific information I needed. Frustrated, I decided to visit another educational institution's website that had a well-organized layout and dedicated sections for each program, displaying comprehensive details. This emphasized the importance of visual hierarchy and effective organization of information on a website, particularly for educational institutions, to enhance user experience and make information easily accessible.
	- **– In the visual hierarchy article, were there topics that surprised you? If so, which one(s) and why?**
		- In the article discussing visual hierarchy, there may be surprising topics that can challenge conventional design principles. Some potential surprises include unconventional layouts that deviate from traditional reading patterns, the importance of negative space in enhancing visual impact, the psychological influence of color on user perception and emotions, and the powerful role of typography in establishing hierarchy. These surprises can expand my understanding of how visual hierarchy works and its impact on design.
