	  ![:tada:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f389@2x.png) Are you super excited about learning **Python**? Check out the program [here](https://aws.amazon.com/training/aws-cloud-institute/?nc2=sb_aci).

	- I attended a very exciting event: JavaScript Day 2023, organized by JetBrains. ![:all-the-things:](https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T07EHJ738/all-the-things/8811b9174bf59363.jpg)

	  Here are the key points summarized by [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) due to a large text extracted from the 8-hour-long video:
	-
	- Here is a summary of Simona Cotin's talk on the State of Angular v17:
	- Angular focuses on developer experience, performance, and embracing standards.
	- New in v17:
		- Deferred loading with <ng-defer> for lazy loading parts of a view
		- Full hydration enabled for hybrid SSR apps
		- Built-in control flow using standard JavaScript syntax
	- Angular CLI makes migrating between versions easy via ng update.
	- Initiatives like Ivy renderer improved performance. Lighthouse scores have improved significantly.
	- SSR and prerendering are simpler with the new Application Builder in v17 using esbuild.
	- Angular DevTools provide insight into change detection and debugging.
	- Angular Signals offers fine-grained reactivity tracking as an alternative to Zone.js.
	- Get involved by providing feedback, contributing, and engaging with the Angular community.
