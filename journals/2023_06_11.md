	- **When was a time you got misinformation or bad advice? What happened?**
		- I was preparing for a software engineering apprenticeship program and wanted to improve my understanding of effective communication skills within a team. I decided to ask ChatGPT for tips on how to communicate effectively in a software development team.
		- However, ChatGPT might have provided a generic or incomplete answer that didn't specifically address the nuances of effective communication within a software engineering context. In such a situation, it was important to recognize the limitations of the AI model and seek more accurate resources to obtain reliable information.

		- A while back, I decided to dip my toes into the world of cryptocurrency investment. I stumbled upon what seemed to be a legitimate platform promising substantial returns. The website exuded professionalism, showcasing profiles of successful investors, and the names and photos of the dealers appeared authentic.
		- Feeling confident in the apparent legitimacy of the platform, I decided to invest. Over time, the platform showcased fake updates of successful transactions and growing profits. However, when I attempted to withdraw my supposed earnings, I encountered unexpected issues. Soon after, the entire website vanished, and I realized that the profiles, and names were all fabricated.
		- Unfortunately, I had fallen victim to a sophisticated social engineering scam. The perpetrators, using a fake identity by using a server in the U.S., had managed to deceive investors, and I ended up losing a $10,000. This experience emphasized the importance of thorough research and verification when dealing with investment platforms, even in the cryptocurrency space, where scams can be prevalent. It served as a valuable lesson to be cautious, use reputable exchanges, and pay attention to red flags to avoid falling prey to fraudulent activities.
