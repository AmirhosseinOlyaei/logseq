	- 1. Share a recent instance of your code not doing what you expected or wanted it to. How did you find out it wasn’t doing what you wanted it to? What did you do to find out why it wasn’t doing what you wanted it to?
		- **Identifying the Issue**: In a recent project, I was working on a feature to display user information from a database. However, when I tried to display the user's email address on the front end, it wasn't showing up. I noticed this issue during testing, where the email field was blank despite there being data in the database.
	- 2. Once you found the bug, how did you approach fixing it?
		- **Debugging Approach**: To identify the root cause, I first checked the database to ensure that the email addresses were indeed being stored correctly. Once I confirmed this, I moved on to the backend code where the data was fetched. I added console.log statements to log the retrieved user object right before sending it to the front end. This helped me identify that the email field was not being included in the object sent to the front end.
	- 3. **Fixing the Bug**: After identifying the issue, I reviewed the backend code responsible for fetching and formatting the user data. I discovered that I had mistakenly omitted the email field when constructing the user object to send to the front end. I corrected this oversight by including the email field in the object, and the issue was resolved.
	- 4. **Lesson Learned**: This debugging process taught me the importance of thorough testing and logging to identify issues. It also reinforced the value of double-checking code for any omissions or mistakes, no matter how small they may seem. Additionally, it highlighted the usefulness of console.log statements and step-by-step debugging to pinpoint problems in the code.
