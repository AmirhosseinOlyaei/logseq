	- To enhance the user experience, we've added a visually engaging animation to our 404 Page Not Found. This aims to make the experience less frustrating for users who land on a non-existent page and helps maintain a positive interaction with our site. ![:star2:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f31f@2x.png)
	- The animation is implemented using the lottie-web library, which allows us to use Adobe After Effects animations on the web through lightweight JSON files. This ensures that our site remains visually appealing without compromising on performance. ![:art:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f3a8@2x.png)
