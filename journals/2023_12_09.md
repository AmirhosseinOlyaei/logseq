	- Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amir, and I'm excited to see such a diverse and talented group here! I'm currently based in Boston, and I'm taking the React class with Code the Dream.
	- I've been loving the hands-on experience with React, using state management to handle the client-side representation of data, and then interacting with a database to perform CRUD operations, and I can't wait to explore more in the upcoming sessions.
	- I've also been grateful for the incredible mentors who not only guide us but also see the potential in each of us. The presentation opportunities they provide have been instrumental in helping me speak the language of development with confidence.
	- What's truly enriching is the study sessions we organize among peers. It's a fantastic way to upskill together, sharing what we've learned and helping one another grasp the content. The pace of the class is another highlight, providing ample time to dive deep into the material while utilizing various resources.â€¨
	  Beyond coding, I enjoy staying active with volleyball to stay healthy.
	- Excited to connect with you all and attend the Practicum/Apprenticeship Information Session on December 15th! ðŸš€ Let's make the most of this learning journey together!
