	- Tell us a little about yourself! Pick at least three and tell us your favorite: sport, food, animal, place to vacation, or hobby!
		- Sport: My favorite sport is volleyball. I'm drawn to its fast-paced nature and the incredible teamwork it requires. There's something exhilarating about perfectly executing a set-spike combination or making a diving save to keep the rally alive.
		- Food: I have a deep appreciation for Persian cuisine. The aromatic spices, tender meats, and fluffy rice create a symphony of flavors. I particularly love koobideh kabob served with saffron-infused rice and a side of refreshing yogurt sauce. The way Persian food balances savory, sweet, and tangy elements is truly masterful.
		- Hobby: Coding and web development aren't just hobbies for meâ€”they're passions that allow me to blend creativity with problem-solving. I find immense satisfaction in crafting elegant solutions and bringing ideas to life through code. Whether it's building a responsive website or creating a useful app, the process of turning concept into reality never fails to excite me.
