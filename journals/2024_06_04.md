- #CodeTheDream #Node  final project
	- The data models for this project include:
	- **User Model**:
		- `username` (string, required)
		- `password` (string, required, hashed)
		- `email` (string, required, unique)
		- `createdAt` (date, default to current date)
		- `updatedAt` (date, updated on every save)
	- **Toy Model**:
		- `name` (string, required)
		- `description` (string)
		- `category` (string)
		- `price` (number, required)
		- `isAvailable` (boolean, default to true)
		- `tags` (array of strings)
		- `createdAt` (date, default to current date)
		- `updatedAt` (date, updated on every save)
		- `owner` (ObjectId, ref to User model, required)
		  
		  The User model stores user information like username, hashed password, and email. The Toy model represents toy listings, including details like name, description, price, availability status, and tags. Each toy listing is associated with a user (owner) through a reference to the User model.
		  
		  Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity, such as requiring certain fields, setting minimum/maximum values, and enforcing uniqueness constraints.
		  
		  The models support CRUD operations:
	- User: Create (registration), Read (profile retrieval)
	- Toy: Create (add new listing), Read (retrieve listings), Update (modify listing details), Delete (remove listing)
	  
	  Additional functionality includes searching toys by name or category, sorting toys by date or price, and implementing access control middleware to restrict certain operations based on user roles or ownership.
