	- As a logged in user, I can see all my projects previously saved in the database 77
		- Description:
		- The issue is about enabling logged-in users to view their previously saved projects from a database. Implementation should consider system architecture, user requirements, and thorough testing to ensure robustness and efficiency.
		  ---
		  Tasks:
		- [x] Design draft model in Figma
		- [x] Design database model in Navicat (and transfer to Supabase)
		- [x] Seed database with dummy data from mockaroo.com
		- [x] Test projects API from webstorm
		- [x] ceate `.env.local` file
		  `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=""`
		  `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=""`
		- [ ] implement displaying projects from API/database:
		- [ ] 1: Implement authentication and authorization functionality in your React app. You can use a library like Supabase Authentication or implement your own authentication system.
		- Supabase api, signup user, provider, google auth
		- [ ] 2: Once the user is logged in, retrieve their user ID or some other unique identifier.
		- [ ] 3: Make a request to your backend API to get the projects associated with the logged-in user. You can use a library like Axios to make API requests.
		- How to pull data from database and display?
		- [ ] 4: Store the projects in state in your React component.
		- [ ] 5: Render the projects in the table body. You can use the map method to iterate over the projects and create a table row for each one.
