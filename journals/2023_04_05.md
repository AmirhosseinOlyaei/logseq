	- **As a logged in user, I can see all my projects previously saved in the database** 77
		- > Description:
		- The issue is about enabling logged-in users to view their previously saved projects from a database. Implementation should consider system architecture, user requirements, and thorough testing to ensure robustness and efficiency.
		  ---
		  > Tasks:
		- [x] Design draft model in Figma
		- [x] Design database model in Navicat (and transfer to Supabase)
		- [x] Seed database with dummy data from mockaroo.com
		- [x] Test projects API from webstorm
		- [x] ceate `.env.local` file
		  `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=""`
		  `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=""`
		- [x] implement displaying projects from API/database:
		- [ ] 1: Implement authentication and authorization functionality in your React app. You can use a library like Supabase Authentication or implement your own authentication system.
		- Supabase api, signup user, provider, google auth
		- [x] 2: Once the user is logged in, retrieve their user ID or some other unique identifier.
		- [x] 3: Make a request to your backend API to get the projects associated with the logged-in user. You can use a library like Axios to make API requests.
		- How to pull data from database and display
		- [x] 4: Store the projects in state in your React component.
		- [x] 5: Render the projects in the table body. You can use the map method to iterate over the projects and create a table row for each one.

	- **User is able to sign up / sign in using google** 32
		- >Description:
		- Allow a user to sign up or sign in using Google in a React application, by integrating Google OAuth (Open Authorization) 2.0 authentication protocol, flow with your front-end and back-end code.
		  ---
		  >Task list:
		- [ ] First, you need to create a project in the Google Developers Console and enable the Google Sign-In API for your project. This will give you a client ID that you'll use later.
		- [ ] In your React app, you can use a third-party library like react-google-login to implement the Google Sign-In button.
		- [ ] When a user clicks the Sign-In button, you'll initiate the OAuth flow by sending an authentication request to Google's OAuth 2.0 endpoint with your client ID and the appropriate scopes.
		- [ ] Once the user has authorized your app, Google will redirect back to your React app with an authorization code.
		- [ ] You can exchange this authorization code for an access token and a refresh token by sending a POST request to Google's token endpoint.
		- [ ] You can then use this access token to make API requests on behalf of the user, and the refresh token to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
		- [ ] To implement sign-up functionality, you'll need to store the user's information in your database or backend after they've signed in with Google.
