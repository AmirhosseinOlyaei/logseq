	- So far in class, have you had any “aha” moments?
		- "Aha" moments: As I learn new concepts and skills, there may be moments where everything suddenly clicks into place, and I have a sudden understanding or realization of how everything fits together. These "aha" moments can be incredibly satisfying and can help solidify my understanding of the material.
	- What have you enjoyed the most? What has been the hardest?
		- Enjoyment and challenges: As I progress through the class, I may find that certain topics or assignments are particularly enjoyable, while others may be more challenging. It is important for me to embrace both the enjoyable and challenging aspects of the class, as both can help me grow and improve my skills.
	- What were you excited/worried about before class started?
	- How do you feel about what’s still to come in this class and in your journey ahead?

	- Excitement and worries: Before starting the class, I may have had certain expectations or concerns about what I would learn or how difficult the material would be. As I progress through the class, I may find that my expectations are met or exceeded, or I may encounter unexpected challenges. It is important for me to remain open-minded and adaptable, and to remember that learning is a process.

	- Journey ahead: As I look ahead to what is still to come in the class and in my journey as a software developer, it is normal to feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty. There may be times when I feel overwhelmed or discouraged, but it is important for me to stay focused on my goals and to remember that every challenge is an opportunity to grow and learn. I should keep an open mind, stay curious, and embrace the journey ahead with enthusiasm and determination.
