- #CodeTheDream #Node
	- To help you align your PlayItForward project with the requirements of your Node.js class final project, I'll break down the rubric and suggest specific improvements or additions you can make to your existing codebase. Hereâ€™s how you can ensure your PlayItForward application meets all the requirements:
	- ### 1.  **Models & Controllers**
	  
	  **a. Mongoose Data Models**
	- **User Model**: Make sure you have a `User` model that includes fields like `username`, `password`, `email`, and other user-specific attributes.
	- **Another Model**: Add or enhance an existing model (e.g., `Toy`, `Transaction`, or `Listing`) that complements the `User` model.
	  
	  **b. User Registration and Logon**
	- **Registration**: Implement a registration endpoint that takes user details and stores them in MongoDB with hashed passwords.
	- **Logon**: Implement JWT-based authentication for a full-stack application or use Passport for a server-side rendered application.
	  
	  **c. Model Attributes**
	- Ensure models use different data types:
		- **Number**: e.g., `price` for a `Toy`.
		- **String**: e.g., `username`, `description`.
		- **Boolean**: e.g., `isAvailable`.
		- **Date**: e.g., `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
		- **Array**: e.g., `tags` for a `Toy` or `likedToys` for a `User`.
		  
		  **d. Validation**
	- Add Mongoose validation to prevent invalid data entries, e.g., `required`, `min`, `max`, `match` for regex.
	  
	  **e. CRUD Operations**
	- Ensure CRUD operations are implemented for non-User models. For example, `Toy` should have:
		- **Create**: Add a new toy listing.
		- **Read**: Retrieve toy listings.
		- **Update**: Modify toy details.
		- **Delete**: Remove a toy listing.
	- **Non-CRUD Operations**: Add search functionality by toy name or category, and sorting by date or price.
	  
	  **f. Access Control Middleware**
	- Use middleware to protect routes that require authentication for create, update, and delete operations.
	- Allow read operations to be unauthenticated if it suits your application.
	  
	  **g. Access Control Logic**
	- Implement logic to ensure users can only access their data. For example, a user can only update or delete their own toy listings.
	  
	  **h. User Notifications**
	- For full-stack applications, return messages from the API to be displayed on the frontend.
	- For server-side applications, use `connect-flash` to store messages in the user session.
	  
	  **i. Error Handling Middleware**
	- Implement middleware to catch errors and return user-friendly messages, e.g., validation errors, unauthorized access, etc.
	  
	  **j. Code Organization**
	- Use best practices for code structure, apply `eslint` and `prettier` for consistency.
	- ### 2.  **User Interface**
	  
	  **a. Registration, Logon, and Logoff**
	- Implement forms for user registration, logon, and logoff.
	  
	  **b. CRUD Operations UI**
	- Provide a UI for all CRUD operations for the non-User model. For example, a toy listing page with options to add, edit, delete, and view toy details.
	  
	  **c. Navigation**
	- Ensure easy navigation with links or buttons to different parts of your application.
	  
	  **d. Styling**
	- Use simple styling initially, focusing on functionality before enhancing the UI design.
	- ### 3.  **Deployment**
	  
	  **a. Security Protections**
	- Integrate security packages like `helmet` and `xss-clean` to secure your application against common vulnerabilities.
	  
	  **b. Deploy to Render.com**
	- Follow Render.com's deployment steps to host your application. Ensure environment variables are securely managed.
	- ### 4.  **Bonus Items**
	  
	  **a. Extra Features**
	- Consider adding features like:
		- A more complex data model involving relationships (e.g., users and multiple toy listings).
		- Integration with an external API for extra functionality, like fetching current toy trends.
		  
		  **b. Testing**
	- Write test cases using `Mocha`, `Chai`, and `Puppeteer` to ensure your application works as expected.
	  
	  **c. API Documentation**
	- Implement `Swagger` to document your API endpoints.
	- ### Steps to Align Your PlayItForward Project
	- **Extract and Review Existing Code**:
		- Download and extract your backend repository.
		- Review existing models, routes, and controllers to understand the current state.
	- **Enhance Models**:
		- Ensure you have at least two models, one being `User` with JWT or Passport-based authentication.
		- Enhance or add models with various data types and validations.
	- **Add/Enhance CRUD Operations**:
		- Check if you have complete CRUD operations for your non-User model.
		- Add non-CRUD functionalities like search and pagination if not already present.
	- **Implement Middleware and Access Control**:
		- Add middleware to enforce access control.
		- Implement logic to ensure users can only manipulate their data.
	- **Enhance the User Interface**:
		- Ensure you have forms and pages for all CRUD operations.
		- Simplify navigation and improve user feedback through messages or status codes.
	- **Implement Security Measures and Deploy**:
		- Add security headers and sanitize input to prevent XSS and other attacks.
		- Deploy your application on Render.com.
	- **Test and Document**:
		- Write and run test cases to validate functionality.
		- Use Swagger to document your API.
		  
		  By following these guidelines, you can enhance your PlayItForward application to meet the requirements of your Node.js class final project.
