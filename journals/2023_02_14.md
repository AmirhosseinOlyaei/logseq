	- [[REST API]] An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. **A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style**. ibm
		- architectural requirements:
			- Client-Server: A server oversees the application's data and state in REST applications.
			- **Stateless: **Client state is not maintained by servers; instead, clients handle their own application state. All of the information needed to process the client’s requests are contained in the requests to the server.
			- **Cacheable:** Servers must indicate whether or not their responses are cacheable.
