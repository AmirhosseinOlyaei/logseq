	- **Situation:**
	- We were tasked with creating a comprehensive plan to build a house using the Pomodoro technique, which breaks work into focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by a short break. The goal was to optimize our planning process and ensure efficient use of time while considering the various tasks and resources required for architectural design.
	-
	- **Task:**
	- Our task was to create a detailed plan for architectural design, breaking it down into several weeks and further into daily tasks. The plan had to account for different aspects of the architectural process, including designing the overall app, utilizing OpenAI and Google Vertex AI for assistance, and integrating Axios for data handling.
	-
	- **Action:**
	- Week 1:
	- **Day 1:** We defined project scope and goals. We researched and gathered necessary information about the architectural design requirements and client preferences.
	- **Day 2:** We used the gathered information to create a rough outline of the overall app design. We collaborated with the client and stakeholders for feedback and adjustments.
	- **Day 3:** We finalized the app design and created a visual representation. We shared the design with the team for review and suggestions.
	- **Day 4:** We implemented OpenAI's generative AI model for Prompt Design 101 project to generate design variations based on user preferences.
	- **Day 5:** We evaluated the design variations generated by the AI model and selected the most suitable option. We made any necessary adjustments to the chosen design.
	-
	- Week 2:
	- **Day 1:** We researched and familiarized ourselves with Google Vertex AI to leverage its capabilities for optimizing the architectural design process.
	- **Day 2:** We identified areas in the architectural process that can benefit from machine learning and AI-driven solutions. We discussed potential applications with the team.
	- **Day 3:** We developed a plan to integrate Google Vertex AI into the architectural design process, such as using its predictive analytics for material selection and energy efficiency analysis.
	- **Day 4:** We implemented the planned integration of Google Vertex AI. We monitored and adjusted the system as needed to ensure accurate predictions and improved design optimization.
	- **Day 5:** We evaluated the impact of Google Vertex AI integration on the architectural design process. We measured the improvements in material selection accuracy, energy efficiency, and overall design quality.
	  
	  Week 3:
	- **Day 1:** We explored the Axios library for efficient data handling and communication between different components of the architectural project.
	- **Day 2:** We designed a data flow architecture using Axios, ensuring seamless transfer of information between the app's frontend and backend.
	- **Day 3:** We implemented Axios in the app's frontend and backend, establishing smooth communication channels and optimizing data transfer.
	- **Day 4:** We conducted rigorous testing of the Axios implementation to identify and resolve any potential issues or bottlenecks.
	- **Day 5:** We measured the impact of Axios on data handling efficiency and overall app performance. We quantified improvements in data transfer speed and reduced latency.
	  
	  **Result:**
	  By structuring the architectural design plan using the Pomodoro technique and following the outlined actions, we were able to achieve the following results:
	- We developed a well-defined overall app design within the allocated time frame.
	- We incorporated OpenAI's generative AI model for prompt design, resulting in a wider range of design options for clients.
	- We successfully integrated Google Vertex AI into the architectural design process, leading to improved material selection accuracy, energy efficiency analysis, and overall design optimization.
	- We implemented Axios for efficient data handling, resulting in faster data transfer and improved app performance.
	  
	  Through the application of the Pomodoro technique and the strategic planning outlined above, the architectural design process was streamlined, resulting in increased productivity and overall project success.
