			- [ ] Milestone 2: API
				- [ ] API research
				- [ ] API calls
				- [ ] API endpoint
			- [ ] Milestone 3: JS
				- [ ] Scope out the logic of JS solution
					- 1. Bring in all DOM elements
					- 2. listen for the "Enter" key press on the #search-box
					- 3. When a user hits enter on their keyboard, send an API request
					- 4. use the value the user types to send an API GET request
					- 5. when the images comes back, display to user in the #images by .appendChild()
					- 6. Display
	- Scope
	- There are a few steps you can take:
	- Define the project scope: This involves identifying the key features and functionalities of the web app. For example,
		- What kind of AI model will be used to generate the images?
		- What kind of historical events will be represented?, and
		- What kind of user interface will be needed?
	- Gather historical data: Collecting relevant information on civil rights history is essential for creating a web app that is historically accurate and meaningful. You can start by researching key events, people, and organizations that played important roles in the civil rights movement.
	- Develop the AI model: You'll need to choose an AI framework to develop the model that generates the images. There are several popular options, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Depending on your level of expertise, you may want to consider collaborating with an AI specialist.
	- Create the user interface: The user interface (UI) is an important component of any web app. You'll need to design a UI that is intuitive, easy to use, and visually appealing. You may also want to consider adding features like image customization options or social media sharing capabilities.
	- Test and refine: Once the web app is complete, it's important to test it thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues. You may also want to gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
	  
	  Overall, creating a web app that uses AI to generate images based on civil rights history requires a combination of historical research, AI development, and web development skills. With careful planning and attention to detail, you can create a web app that is both informative and engaging.
