- #CtD #[[Mindset Assignment]] #Node Week 5
  collapsed:: true
	- 1. **So far in class, have you had any "aha" moments? What have you enjoyed the most? What has been the hardest?**
		- "Aha" moments: One significant "aha" moment was understanding how asynchronous operations work in Node.js, especially with event emitters and asynchronous file handling. It was a game-changer in how I approach non-blocking code.
		- Enjoyment: I've enjoyed diving deep into the backend technologies and learning about Express.js. Building an example application with various routes, middleware, and error handling was particularly satisfying.
		- Hardest: The most challenging aspect has been grasping the intricacies of asynchronous programming and error handling in Node.js. It's a different way of thinking compared to front-end development.
	- 2. **What were you excited/worried about before class started?**
		- Excited: I was excited about expanding my knowledge in backend development and getting hands-on experience with Node.js, which is crucial for my goal of becoming a full-stack developer.
		- Worried: I was worried about the steep learning curve and keeping up with the class material, especially since I was also involved in the React practicum and had teaching assistant responsibilities.
	- 3. **How do you feel about what's still to come in this class and in your journey ahead?**
		- I feel positive and motivated about the remaining part of the Node class and my journey as a software developer. While I know there will be challenges, especially in mastering complex backend concepts, I'm eager to continue learning and applying my skills in real-world projects. The knowledge gained from this class will be instrumental in achieving my goals in full-stack development and cloud application development.
