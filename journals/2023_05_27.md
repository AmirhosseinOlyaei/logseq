- [[CtD]] [[Mindset Assignment]] week 7
	- – What’s your rule of thumb for when to ask for help?
		- Exhausted resources: If I've thoroughly searched documentation, online resources, forums, and relevant documentation related to the problem but haven't found a satisfactory solution, it may be time to seek assistance.
		- Time constraints: If the issue is time-sensitive, and I’m unable to meet deadlines or deliverables, it's wise to reach out for help. Timely resolution becomes crucial in such situations.
		- Complexity and impact: Considering the complexity and impact of the problem. If the issue has significant consequences, affects critical functionality, or has a wide-reaching impact on the project, seeking assistance can help mitigate risks and minimize potential setbacks.
		- Limited expertise: If the problem involves a domain or technology outside of my expertise or comfort zone, asking for help from someone with relevant knowledge and experience can save time and ensure a more accurate resolution.
		- Fresh perspective: Sometimes, discussing the problem with others can provide fresh insights and alternative approaches that I may not have considered. Collaborating with peers or experienced developers can lead to innovative solutions.

	- – When is an instance where you wish you would have asked for help sooner?
		- When I encounter a persistent and time-consuming bug or issue that I struggle to solve independently. I may spend a significant amount of time trying various approaches, researching, and troubleshooting but make little progress.
		- In such cases, seeking assistance from peers, colleagues, or online communities earlier in the process could have potentially provided valuable insights, alternative perspectives, or knowledge that may have led to a quicker resolution. By waiting too long to ask for help, I may delay project progress, miss deadlines, or spend excessive time on a problem that could have been solved more efficiently with external input.
	-
	- – What information have you found crucial to include in your questions so that mentors or peers can help answer your questions quicker?
		- Clear problem description: Clearly explaining what I’m trying to achieve, what steps I’ve taken so far, and the specific issue or error I’m encountering.
		- Reproduction steps: Providing a detailed sequence of actions or specific input data that lead to the issue. This helps others understand and replicate the problem in their own environment.
		- Relevant code snippets: Highlighting the specific lines or sections that I suspect are causing the issue. Providing context through code snippets helps others analyze and identify potential sources of the problem.
		- Error messages and logs: If there are any error messages, warnings, or relevant log outputs, including them in my question.
	- -Research efforts: Mentioning the steps I've already taken to research and troubleshoot the problem. Describing the resources, documentation, and online references I've consulted.
	- -
	- Environment and technology details: Specifying the relevant environment and technologies involved. Including information such as programming language, frameworks, libraries, operating system, and browser versions. This allows others to consider specific compatibility issues or dependencies that might be contributing to the problem.
	- -
	- Expected outcome: Clearly stating the expected behavior or outcome I’m aiming for. This helps mentors or peers understand my goal and evaluate whether the current issue aligns with the desired outcome.
