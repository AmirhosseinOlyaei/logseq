	- ## Technology Stack
	  
	  1. Next.js v15+, React v19+ as core framework

	  4. Redux toolkit for global state management
	  5. TypeScript with strict mode enabled for all code
	  6. Zod for form and data validation schemas
	  7. NextAuth.js for authentication flows
	  8. MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling and storage
	  9. Framer Motion for animations (with reduced motion alternatives)
	  10. Always check package.json before adding new code
	  11. Implement proper error boundaries around components
	  12. Lucide React for icons
	  13. Embla Carousel for carousels/sliders

	  15. next-themes for theme management
	  16. sonner for toast notifications
	  17. class-variance-authority for shadcn/ui component styling
	- ## UI Component Consistency
	  
	  1. Always use shadcn/ui components over custom-styled elements for consistent theming
	  2. When navigation requires a button appearance, use Button with asChild prop wrapping Link
	  3. Favor component composition over duplicate styling to maintain a single source of truth
	  4. Preserve accessibility features by using proper shadcn/ui patterns and Radix primitives
	  5. Ensure dark mode compatibility through shadcn/ui's theme variables and CSS variables
	  6. Create custom compound components when UI patterns repeat across the application
	  7. Avoid direct Tailwind class overrides when shadcn/ui components provide prop alternatives
	- ## Accessibility (A11y)
	  
	  1. Semantic HTML(nav,main,section,article) for proper document structure
	  2. h1-h6 hierarchy for logical content organization
	  3. Use visible labels for inputs; aria-label only when space-constrained
	  4. aria-labelledby to associate elements with their headings
	  5. alt text for all informative images; empty alt for decorative
	  6. aria-hidden="true" for purely decorative elements
	  7. Full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
	  8. Visible focus states with minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
	  9. Focus trapping in modals and dialogs
	  10. aria-live regions for dynamic content updates
	  11. Honor prefers-reduced-motion for animations
	  12. Screen reader compatibility testing
	  13. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all components
	  14. Color not used as the sole means of conveying information
	  15. Interactive elements must have visible :hover and :focus states
	  16. Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA roles
	  17. Add ARIA roles for all custom interactive components
	  18. Use landmark roles only when semantic HTML isn't possible
	  19. Limit role="alert" to critical, time-sensitive updates
	- ## E-Commerce Best Practices
	  
	  1. Schema.org structured data for products and farms (SEO)
	  2. Persistent shopping cart with local storage fallback
	  3. Robust product filtering with multiple parameters
	  4. Strong farm-product-order data relationship modeling
	  5. Mobile-first responsive design approach
	  6. Geolocation features for discovering nearby farms
	  7. PCI-DSS compliant payment processing
	  8. GDPR compliant data handling and user consent
	  9. Next/Image optimization for all product images
	  10. Pagination for all listing pages with proper indicators
	  11. Comprehensive testing of checkout and inventory flows
	  12. Accessibility considerations for product forms
	  13. Support for multiple payment methods
	- ## Development Workflow
	  
	  1. Component reusability through composition
	  2. Consistent error handling patterns
	  3. Clear loading/progress indicators
	  4. Responsive breakpoints: mobile, tablet, desktop, large
	  5. Defensive coding to handle edge cases
	  6. Meaningful code comments for complex logic
	  7. Performance monitoring for critical user journeys
	  8. Effective cache strategies for product data
	  9. Regular security reviews and dependency updates
	  10. Commit messages follow conventional commits
	  11. Pull requests require passing tests and code review
	  12. Code splitting for better initial load performance
	  13. Avoid prop drilling with context or state management
	  14. Use try-catch blocks for all async operations (API calls, file operations, database queries)
	  15. Implement centralized error handling with custom error classes for different error types
	  16. Always provide meaningful error messages and log with appropriate severity levels
	  17. For React components, use Error Boundaries as the component-level equivalent of try-catch
	- ## Data Handling
	  
	  1. Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas
	  2. Implement proper error handling for API failures
	  3. Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
	  4. Handle loading, error, and empty states for all data fetching
	  5. Implement data caching strategies for frequently accessed data
	  6. Keep sensitive user data encrypted at rest
	  7. Implement proper database indexing for performance
	  8. Include data migration strategies for schema changes
	  9. Maintain audit trails for critical operations
	- ## Project-Specific Requirements
	  
	  1. Support for seasonal product availability tracking
	  2. Farm verification and quality assurance processes

	  3. Use HTTP-only cookies for sensitive session data
	  4. Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
	  5. Implement proper Content Security Policy headers
	  6. Regular vulnerability scanning for dependencies
	  7. Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
	- ## Performance Imperatives
	  
	  1. Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS)
	  2. Server-side rendering for SEO-critical pages
	  3. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
	  4. Optimize critical rendering path for key pages
