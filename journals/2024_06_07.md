	- **User Authentication**:
	- User registration with hashed passwords
	- User login with JWT-based authentication (for full-stack applications) or Passport.js (for server-side rendered applications)
	- User logout functionality
	- **Toy Listing Management**:
	- Create new toy listing
	- Read/retrieve toy listings
	- Update existing toy listing details
	- Delete toy listing
	- **Toy Listing Search and Sorting**:
	- Search functionality to find toy listings by name or category
	- Sorting of toy listings by date or price
	- **Access Control**:
	- Middleware to protect routes that require authentication for create, update, and delete operations
	- Allow read operations to be unauthenticated (if suitable for the application)
	- Implement logic to ensure users can only access and manipulate their own toy listings (create, update, delete)
	- **User Notifications**:
	- For full-stack applications, return messages from the API to be displayed on the frontend
	- For server-side applications, use `connect-flash` to store messages in the user session
	- **Error Handling**:
	- Implement error handling middleware to catch errors and return user-friendly messages (e.g., validation errors, unauthorized access)
	- **User Interface**:
	- Forms for user registration, login, and logout
	- UI for CRUD operations on toy listings (add, view, edit, delete)
	- Navigation links or buttons to different parts of the application
	- Basic styling (focus on functionality first, enhance UI design later)
	- **Security Measures**:
	- Integrate security packages like `helmet` and `xss-clean` to secure the application against common vulnerabilities
	- **Deployment**:
	- Deploy the application to Render.com, ensuring secure management of environment variables
	- **Bonus Features (optional)**:
	- More complex data model involving relationships (e.g., users and multiple toy listings)
	- Integration with an external API for additional functionality (e.g., fetching current toy trends)
	- Implement testing with Mocha, Chai, and Puppeteer
	- API documentation using Swagger
