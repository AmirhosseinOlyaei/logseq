	  # Accessibility Guidelines for Harvest Haven
	  1
	  ## Semantic HTML
	  - Use proper semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, etc.)
	  - Maintain a logical heading hierarchy (h1 through h6)
	  - Use lists (<ul>, <ol>) for groups of related items
	  
	  ## ARIA Attributes and Labels
	  - Add aria-label to all form inputs without visible labels
	  - Use aria-labelledby to associate elements with their headings
	  - Add aria-describedby for elements needing additional description
	  - Include role attributes when HTML semantics need clarification
	  - Mark decorative images with aria-hidden="true"
	  - Add ARIA landmarks for major page sections (role="banner", role="main", etc.)
	  
	  ## Focus Management
	  - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable
	  - Maintain a logical tab order
	  - Visibly indicate focus state with focus-visible styles
	  - Trap focus in modals and dialogs
	  - Return focus to trigger elements after closing overlays
