	- Updated list:
		- ```
		  ## Harvest Haven Best Practices
		  
		  ## Technology Stack
		  -Next.js v14+ as core framework
		  -shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives for accessible components
		  -Tailwind CSS for styling with tailwind-merge for class conflicts
		  -Redux toolkit for global state management
		  -TypeScript with strict mode enabled for all code
		  -Zod for form and data validation schemas
		  -NextAuth.js for authentication flows
		  -MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling and storage
		  -Framer Motion for animations (with reduced motion alternatives)
		  -Always check package.json before adding new code
		  -No new dependencies without explicit approval
		  -Use React Server Components for better performance when possible
		  -Implement proper error boundaries around components
		  
		  ## Accessibility (A11y)
		  -Semantic HTML(nav,main,section,article) for proper document structure
		  -h1-h6 hierarchy for logical content organization
		  -Use visible labels for inputs; aria-label only when space-constrained
		  -aria-labelledby to associate elements with their headings
		  -alt text for all informative images; empty alt for decorative
		  -aria-hidden="true" for purely decorative elements
		  -Full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
		  -Visible focus states with minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
		  -Focus trapping in modals and dialogs
		  -aria-live regions for dynamic content updates
		  -Honor prefers-reduced-motion for animations
		  -Screen reader compatibility testing
		  -WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all components
		  -Color not used as the sole means of conveying information
		  -Interactive elements must have visible :hover and :focus states
		  -Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA roles (use <button> not <div role="button">)
		  -Add ARIA roles for all custom interactive components
		  -Use landmark roles only when semantic HTML isn't possible
		  -Limit role="alert" to critical, time-sensitive updates
		  
		  ## E-Commerce Best Practices
		  -Schema.org structured data for products and farms (SEO)
		  -Persistent shopping cart with local storage fallback
		  -Robust product filtering with multiple parameters
		  -Strong farm-product-order data relationship modeling
		  -Mobile-first responsive design approach
		  -Geolocation features for discovering nearby farms
		  -PCI-DSS compliant payment processing
		  -GDPR compliant data handling and user consent
		  -Next/Image optimization for all product images
		  -Pagination for all listing pages with proper indicators
		  -Comprehensive testing of checkout and inventory flows
		  -Order confirmation emails and notifications
		  -Accessibility considerations for product forms
		  -Support for multiple payment methods
		  -Cart abandonment recovery strategies
		  
		  ## Development Workflow
		  -Component reusability through composition
		  -Consistent error handling patterns
		  -Clear loading/progress indicators
		  -Responsive breakpoints: mobile, tablet, desktop, large
		  -Defensive coding to handle edge cases
		  -Meaningful code comments for complex logic
		  -Performance monitoring for critical user journeys
		  -Effective cache strategies for product data
		  -Structured logging standards for debugging
		  -Regular security reviews and dependency updates
		  -Automated accessibility scans in CI pipeline
		  -User testing workflows for all new features
		  -Git branch naming: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/
		  -Commit messages follow conventional commits
		  -Pull requests require passing tests and code review
		  -Code splitting for better initial load performance
		  -Avoid prop drilling with context or state management
		  -Document complex business logic with comments
		  -Use try-catch blocks for all async operations (API calls, file operations, database queries)
		  -Implement centralized error handling with custom error classes for different error types
		  -Always provide meaningful error messages and log with appropriate severity levels
		  -For React components, use Error Boundaries as the component-level equivalent of try-catch
		  
		  ## Data Handling
		  -Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas
		  -Implement proper error handling for API failures
		  -Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
		  -Handle loading, error, and empty states for all data fetching
		  -Implement data caching strategies for frequently accessed data
		  -Keep sensitive user data encrypted at rest
		  -Implement proper database indexing for performance
		  -Include data migration strategies for schema changes
		  -Maintain audit trails for critical operations
		  
		  ## Project-Specific Requirements
		  -Support for seasonal product availability tracking
		  -Farm verification and quality assurance processes
		  -Ratings and reviews system for products and farms
		  -Support for various units of measurement (imperial/metric)
		  -Delivery radius and shipping cost calculations
		  -Support for CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) subscriptions
		  -Product categorization by dietary restrictions
		  -Recipe suggestions based on available products
		  -Harvest calendars for seasonal planning
		  -Local event listings for farm activities
		  
		  ## Critical Security Requirements
		  -Implement CSRF protection for all forms
		  -Apply rate limiting on authentication endpoints
		  -Use HTTP-only cookies for sensitive session data
		  -Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
		  -Implement proper Content Security Policy headers
		  -Regular vulnerability scanning for dependencies
		  -Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
		  -No hard-coded secrets in codebase (use env variables)
		  
		  ## Performance Imperatives
		  -Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS)
		  -Server-side rendering for SEO-critical pages
		  -Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
		  -Optimize critical rendering path for key pages
		  -Set up performance budgets and monitoring
		  -Use edge caching for static content when possible
		  -Implement HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections
		  -Optimize and compress all static assets
		  
		  ## International/Localization Support
		  -Design for text expansion in translations (30-50%)
		  -Support for multiple currencies and payment methods
		  -Implement proper number/date/currency formatting
