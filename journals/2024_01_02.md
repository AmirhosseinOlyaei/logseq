		- HiÂ [@Dele](https://ulem.slack.com/team/U035K61K3HR),Happy New Year! It's always exciting to see the innovative and cutting-edge techniques you bring to each cohort.
		- I'm intrigued by the opportunity to volunteer as a TA for the MSIMBO program. My time in coding bootcamp really ignited my passion for web and cloud application development. The program's focus on integrating AI-first strategies aligns perfectly with my desire to explore how data analytics and thoughtful design can be leveraged to create more effective and user-friendly applications.Considering my full-time work commitments, I am confident that I can commit to occasionally joining the online sessions and assisting learners. This presents a fantastic opportunity to give back to the community while deepening my own understanding, especially in AI-related areas.A few questions come to mind:
		- Could you provide more details on the time commitment expected for a TA? I want to ensure I can balance this with my ongoing projects effectively.
		- Are there specific topics or areas within the program where you foresee the need for more TA support?
		- How would the feedback process work? I'm keen on understanding how TAs can contribute to the evolution of the program and materials.
		- I am eager to discuss this opportunity further and look forward to the possibility of working together and contributing to this innovative program.|
