	- >**Have you implemented/used any new strategies since the previous post on how to ask for help? If so what were they and how did they turn out for you?**
	- >**After reading the article what changes (if any) will you make to your strategy?**
	- >**What are some ways you can determine which “circle” (inner circle of things you know, middle circle of things you can figure out on your own, outer circle of things you don’t know and can’t learn by yourself) your blocker/bug/issue falls into?**

	- 1. Since the previous post on how to ask for help, I have implemented a new strategy. I now make sure to exhaust my resources before seeking assistance. I thoroughly search documentation, online resources, forums, and relevant documentation related to the problem. This approach has been quite effective in solving issues independently and has saved me time. By exploring various resources and trying different solutions, I have been able to find satisfactory resolutions without needing external help.

	- 2. After reading the article, I realize the importance of being more strategic in framing my requests for help. I will now take the time to clearly explain why I am seeking help and how it aligns with shared goals or the other person's interests. By highlighting the potential benefits for both parties, I can create a more compelling case for assistance. Additionally, I will focus on expressing sincere appreciation and following up with the person who provides help. These changes will enhance my ability to seek help effectively and build stronger collaborative relationships.

	- 3. To determine the circle my blocker/bug/issue falls into, I can consider the following approaches:
	- Inner circle (things I know): If the problem aligns with my existing knowledge and expertise, I should be able to address it independently without significant effort.
	- Middle circle (things I can figure out on my own): If the issue is within my capability to solve but requires additional research, experimentation, or learning, it falls in the middle circle. With some effort and resources, I should be able to resolve it without seeking external help.
	- Outer circle (things I don't know and can't learn by myself): If the problem involves areas or technologies outside of my expertise or comfort zone, and I lack the necessary resources or knowledge to tackle it alone, it falls in the outer circle. In this case, seeking help from someone with relevant expertise becomes crucial.
	  
	  By evaluating the complexity of the problem, considering my own skills and available resources, and recognizing the limitations of my knowledge, I can determine which circle the blocker/bug/issue belongs to and make an informed decision on whether to seek external assistance.
