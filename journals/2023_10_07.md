			  cd react-todo-vite-tailwind

			  ```
			- Create React App does not support custom PostCSS configurations and is incompatible with many important tools in the PostCSS ecosystem, like ``postcss-import``.
			- Using [Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) instead of Create React App. It provide an equivalent or better developer experience but with more flexibility, giving you more control over how Tailwind and PostCSS are configured.
