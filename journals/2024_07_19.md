	- Responsible AI ensures artificial intelligence is developed and used ethically, fairly, and safely. Key principles include:
	- Fairness: Avoiding bias to prevent AI from perpetuating discrimination and ensuring equity to provide equal opportunities for all.
	- Transparency: Ensuring explainability by providing clear explanations of AI decisions and accountability by clarifying responsibility for AI outcomes.
	- Privacy and Security: Protecting data by safeguarding personal information and obtaining user consent for data use.
	- Safety and Reliability: Ensuring robustness by making AI perform reliably and minimizing risks to avoid harm.
	- Inclusiveness: Designing AI to be accessible for all, including marginalized groups, and involving diverse stakeholders in the process.
	- Sustainability: Reducing AI's environmental impact through efficiency and considering long-term societal and environmental effects.
	- Ethical Use: Enhancing human well-being (beneficence) and avoiding harm (non-maleficence).
	- Human-Centric Design: Respecting human emotions and values (empathy) and empowering individuals by giving them control over AI technologies.
	- Implementation Practices: Conducting regular audits to assess compliance with ethical standards, engaging stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, and providing ongoing education and training on ethical AI practices.
	- These principles guide the creation of AI systems that are ethical, fair, and beneficial to society.
