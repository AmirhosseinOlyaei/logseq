	  Hey Code the Dream Community! 👋
	  
	  I hope this message finds you all well. I wanted to share an exciting opportunity that has come up, thanks to the guidance and support of my esteemed instructor, Dele.
	  
	  About the Opportunity:
	  Considering the rapid advancements in AI and coding, there's a plethora of immediate opportunities for those looking to dive into the tech world. My former instructor and I had a fruitful discussion about the current market trends and how we can leverage these opportunities.
	  
	  To summarize our conversation, we're exploring the idea of forming a tech cohort, a collaborative space where we can pool our skills and kickstart our careers. The goal is to take advantage of the growing demand for independent tech consultants, particularly in the realm of freelance development.
	  
	  Key Points:
	- Time and Money: We're aware that entry-level jobs are limited, and contract roles might be the fastest way to enter the market.
	- Guidance from Dele: Our experienced instructor, Dele, will provide valuable insights and mentorship throughout the program.
	- Freelance and Development: We aim to equip ourselves with the skills necessary for freelance development.
	- Tools for CMS and App Development: Exploring tools like
		- n8n.io (a powerful workflow automation tool and supports integration with machine learning platforms),
		- NocoDB Cloud (a no-code database),
		- Weaviate (the most popular vector DB to build and scale AI applications),
		- BuildShip (a low-code back-end builder), and
		- FlutterFlow (for building apps incredibly fast).
	- AI and Low Code: Leveraging AI and low-code tools to rapidly build full-stack applications.
	- Independent Developer and Consultant Roles: Preparing ourselves for the roles of independent developers and consultants.
	- New Workflow and Marketing: Utilizing new workflows, demo calls, and showcasing our skills to secure contracts, with exciting contract opportunities on the horizon.
	  
	  Who Can Join:
	- Practicum graduates with at least one full-stack web application on their resume.
	- Individuals passionate about advancing their tech careers and exploring the cutting-edge landscape of tasks automation, and low to no-code development. 
	  
	  Affordability:
	  We aim to keep the program as accessible as possible for everyone interested in advancing their tech careers.
	  
	  Next Steps:
