	- **As a logged in user, I can see all my projects previously saved in the database**
	- Description:
		- The issue is about enabling logged-in users to view their previously saved projects from a database. Implementation should consider system architecture, user requirements, and thorough testing to ensure robustness and efficiency.
	- TODO Tasks:
		- Design draft model in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mDq6Oc71KJAspqes7aPDYW/Supabase?node-id=0-1&t=3MA8yyUPHeDRvuKn-0)
