	- ### Ticket Title:
	  Integrate Prettier for Code Formatting Consistency
	- ### Ticket Description:
	  **Description:**
	  To ensure code formatting consistency across the project and enhance readability, we propose integrating Prettier, a popular code formatting tool. Prettier enforces a consistent style by parsing code and re-printing it with its own rules, which can significantly improve the overall quality and maintainability of our codebase.
	  
	  **Objectives:**
	  1. Integrate Prettier into the project.
	  2. Configure Prettier according to our coding standards.
	  3. Update the project's documentation to include Prettier setup and usage instructions.
	  4. Ensure Prettier runs automatically as part of the pre-commit hook.
	  
	  **Tasks:**
	  1. Install Prettier as a development dependency.
	  2. Create a Prettier configuration file (`.prettierrc`) in the root directory.
	  3. Update the project's ESLint configuration to work with Prettier.
	  4. Modify the `package.json` scripts to include a Prettier format command.
	  5. Set up a pre-commit hook to run Prettier on staged files using Husky and lint-staged.
	  6. Format the existing codebase using Prettier.
	  7. Update the README.md file with instructions on how to use Prettier in the project.
	  
	  **Acceptance Criteria:**
	  1. Prettier is successfully integrated and configured.
	  2. The codebase is formatted consistently according to Prettier rules.
	  3. Developers can run Prettier via a script in `package.json`.
	  4. Prettier automatically formats staged files before commits.
	  
	  **Priority:** Medium
	  
	  **Assignee:** [Assign to the relevant team member]
	  
	  **Due Date:** [Set an appropriate due date]
	  
	  **Attachments:** [Attach any relevant files or screenshots]
	  
	  Feel free to adjust the objectives, tasks, and acceptance criteria according to the specific needs of your project.
