- #CodeTheDream #practicum
	- Gaetan Siry, and Marice Romero. Exceptional project manager and apprentice.
	  Working with them at Code The Dream practicum was an incredibly enriching experience, and I truly appreciated their guidance and mentorship throughout our project. Their support played a crucial role in my development.
	- Response to project manager (Gaetan):
		- 1. Mental and Physical Health:
		   Mentally, I'm feeling accomplished and motivated after working on the practicum project. It has been a challenging but rewarding journey that has significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth. Physically, I've been managing well despite the rigorous demands of the project, making sure to balance work with adequate rest and physical activity.
		- 2. Contribution to the PlayItForward Project:
		   I contributed significantly to the front-end development of the PlayItForward project, focusing on implementing responsive and accessible UI components using React and CSS Modules. My efforts were aimed at enhancing user experience and ensuring the application's design was both functional and visually appealing. Additionally, I actively participated in our Agile-Scrum processes, contributing to planning, stand-ups, and reviews which helped keep the project on track, and set an example for the team to build upon.
		- 3. Strengths in the Project:
		   One area where I excelled was in problem-solving and debugging. I was able to efficiently tackle issues as they arose, which kept the project moving forward without significant delays. My ability to adapt and learn quickly was crucial, especially when integrating new technologies or adjusting to changing project requirements.
		- 4. Areas for Improvement:
		   For future projects, during the team-building phase, I would select team members who have demonstrated strong skills in React classes to minimize the time needed for training during the practicum. Additionally, I would ensure that all team members can dedicate the full two months to the project. This approach would prevent the need for any single team member to cover multiple roles unexpectedly, as happened in the last three weeks when I had to work on both front-end and back-end tasks to meet our project requirements.
		- 5. Proudest Achievement:
		   I am most proud of the cohesive, dynamic user interface we developed for PlayItForward. Seeing my technical skills translate into a tangible product that will benefit users gives me a great sense of pride and accomplishment. Moreover, receiving positive feedback on the usability and design of the application has been particularly rewarding.
		- 6. Next Steps:
		   Having gained substantial experience and confidence from this practicum, I feel ready to pursue an internship or entry-level job in software development. I am eager to apply the skills I've honed, particularly in React and front-end development, in a professional setting. I believe I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to a tech team and continue growing my skills in a real-world environment.

	- **Team reflection:**
		- **Doina Fitchevici, Hanna Akhramchuk, Alevtina Babinskaya, and Betiel Amanuel** team members of Ferret / Flamingo Practicum - Team 4 - PlayItForward, demonstrated commendable dedication and teamwork throughout the project. Each member consistently attended meetings, actively engaged in communication on Slack, and provided valuable updates during stand-ups.
		- Their strong collaboration skills significantly contributed to both the design and coding aspects of our project, showcasing proficiency in React and CSS. The reliability of the team in maintaining connectivity and their essential contributions in development were crucial to our success. The energy and dedication brought by the team enhanced dynamics and project delivery, while their dependable participation in both design and coding phases were instrumental in achieving our project objectives.

	- **Can be improved?**
		- Rodgers Onchanah excelled in asynchronous communication during the Ferret / Flamingo Practicum - Team 4 - PlayItForward, effectively compensating for the time zone differences between East Africa and the US. Despite the challenges posed by his inability to join live meetings, Rodgers maintained a steady flow of updates and contributions through various communication channels, ensuring his participation and input were well integrated into the projectâ€™s progress.
		- His proactive approach in setting up the backend schema was commendable and laid a solid foundation for our project. However, his involvement was unavoidably affected during the last three weeks of the practicum due to severe flooding in his town.
		- Looking ahead, continuing to strengthen these asynchronous communication skills will be key for Rodgers, and establishing a more robust contingency plan will help maintain his contributions during any future disruptions.
