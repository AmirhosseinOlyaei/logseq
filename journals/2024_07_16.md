- #CodeTheDream #apprenticeship
	- I created a story about my dev journey during the past two years:
	- My journey over the past two years has been one of intense dedication and relentless pursuit of knowledge in the field of software development. Being single and having fewer responsibilities allowed me to plan and execute my career goals with more intensity and focus. I immersed myself in the world of development, watching and listening to hundreds of hours of content from podcasts like Syntax, educational webinars, and meticulously documenting my learnings with Notion and Logseq. This approach kept me abreast of the latest industry trends and best practices.
	- Applying to hundreds of roles not only honed my knowledge of what technical skills are required for the roles Iâ€™m passionate about, but also significantly improved my soft skills. Through invaluable feedback from mentors and recruiters, I refined my resume, optimized my LinkedIn profile, and sharpened my interview techniques. This continuous feedback loop was instrumental in my professional development.
	- Since 2022, I have undertaken an extensive educational journey, participating in back-to-back bootcamps. I completed a 4-month remote full-time AWS Cloud Practitioner program, gaining foundational knowledge in cloud computing. This was followed by a 5-month full-time hybrid Web Development bootcamp in Boston, where I learned the intricacies of both frontend and backend development. I then dived into a 2-month full-time Java bootcamp, which solidified my understanding of object-oriented programming.
	- Additionally, I spent one year in part-time classes at Code the Dream (CTD), covering Intro, React, Practicum, and Node. As an alum of CTD, I can attest to the transformative journey this program offers. Having mastered the fundamentals of modern web development technologies like React and Node.js, CTD has empowered me with the expertise and self-assurance to navigate complex real-world scenarios and develop impactful applications.
	- The program's emphasis on practicum experience through collaborative projects and an agile workflow has equipped me with the invaluable ability to work cohesively within a team, fostering seamless communication and efficient problem-solving. This hands-on approach has enabled me to hone my skills in building robust full-stack applications, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and industry-ready proficiency.
	- What truly sets CTD apart is not just the technical training, but the incredible community of mentors, peers, and professionals who are all committed to supporting each other's growth and success. The sense of belonging and the opportunities for collaboration and networking are truly unparalleled.
	- The culmination of these efforts was my acceptance as an apprentice at Code the Dream, a testament to my hard work and dedication. This apprenticeship marks a significant milestone in my career. For the first time, I can leverage my skills to earn a living as a software developer. This role allows me to put all backend classes and projects on hold temporarily to focus on frontend development with React and Next.js, where I can make a significant impact.
	- This journey has not only been about acquiring technical skills but also about personal growth and resilience. I am excited to continue this path, contributing to the tech community and growing as a professional software developer.
